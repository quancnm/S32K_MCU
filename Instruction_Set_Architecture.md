# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):

 **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. 
* The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done.

* The ISA defines the various **instructions**, **registers** and **memory addressing** modes that the processor would support, at a hardware level. Software created to run on an ISA would be designed to use the ISA's instructions, register and memory addressing modes.



## Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC): 

 **Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)** is a type of microprocessor that is designed with a **large complex set of instructions**. 

* In a CISC processor, a single instruction has **‘several low-level operations’**, which makes the instructions relatively short but inherently complex.

* The primary goal of a CISC processor is to **reduce the number of instructions** in a program, thereby **minimizing overall program size**.

      • CISC was designed when memory was smaller and costlier; today, memory is inexpensive and abundant, making this design less efficient.

## Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC):
 **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)** is a type of microprocessor that is designed with a **large complex set of instructions**. 

* The main objective of a CISC processor is to minimize the program size by reducing the number of instructions in a program.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align:top;">
      • There are very few instructions in the RISC instruction set. <br><br>
      • RISC instructions have simple addressing modes. <br><br>
      • Each RISC instruction executes in a single clock cycle. <br><br>
      • RISC executes faster because most instructions operate on processor registers, avoiding frequent memory access. <br><br>
      • Pipelining is easier since all RISC instructions are of fixed size with opcode and operand in the same position. 
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align:top;">
      • Although RISC instructions are smaller, more instructions are required to perform an operation compared with CISC. <br><br>
      • Machine instructions are hardwired in RISC, making modifications costly. <br><br>
      • It struggles with complex instructions and complex addressing modes. <br><br>
      • RISC does not allow direct memory-to-memory transfers; it requires separate Load and Store instructions.

# Personal opinion:

RISC is more suitable for modern embedded systems due to:

* Offers higher execution speed and better pipelining.

* Consumes less power, ideal for mobile and IoT devices.

* Simpler hardware design, easier to implement and cost-effective.

* Widely adopted in practice (ARM, RISC-V) → industry standard.
